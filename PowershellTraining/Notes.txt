A cmdlet (pronounced "command-let") is a compiled command. A cmdlet can be developed in .NET or .NET Core and invoked as a command within PowerShell. 
Thousands of cmdlets are available in your PowerShell installation. 
The challenge lies in discovering what the cmdlets are and what they can do for you.

Cmdlets are named according to a verb-noun naming standard. 
This pattern can help you to understand what they do and how to search for them. It also helps cmdlet developers create consistent names. 
You can see the list of approved verbs by using the Get-Verb cmdlet. Verbs are organized according to activity type and function.

Get-Verb:

Three core cmdlets allow you to delve into what cmdlets exist and what they do:

Get-Command: 
The Get-Command cmdlet lists all of the available cmdlets on your system. 
Filter the list to quickly find the command you need.

Get-Help: 
Run the Get-Help core cmdlet to invoke a built-in help system. 
You can also run an alias help command to invoke Get-Help but improve the reading experience by paginating the response.


Get-Member: 
When you call a command, the response is an object that contains many properties. 
Run the Get-Member core cmdlet to drill down into that response and learn more about it.
